# Archlinux docker images with VNC remote access
This project is aiming to provide remote desktop access with container images.

Host is a cloud-based Arch Linux running docker. I'm hosting a server on UpCloud
as a testing environment. I have posted a guide how to install Arch Linux there:

https://upcloud.com/community/tutorials/install-arch-linux/

Containers are custom built, as a general guide, I'm using the following repo:

https://github.com/archlinux/archlinux-docker

goal is to automate the whole dockerimage creation process with customizations
needed to provide a remote desktop environment.
